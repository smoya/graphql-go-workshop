# GraphQL in Go Workshop

## Introduction

The purpose of this light workshop is to generate a GraphQL API on top of a partially-existing model. 
For this exercise we are going to use a simple library that fetches data from [Meetup.com API](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api) such as groups, events and rsvps.

The idea of this workshop is to generate a GraphQL API capable of fetching a Meetup.com group among of its events and rsvps.
